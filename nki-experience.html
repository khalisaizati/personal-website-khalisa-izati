<p>Everyone have their own experience based on their journey in life. Same goes to me, I have a lot of experience from the first until time right now. I would like to share the most memorable experience that I had in My life.</p>
<p> In Januari 2020, I had finish My Diploma Study at Universiti Teknologi Mara, Machang, Kelantan. During my diploma study I not just focused on academic but I also involved and take part in non academic which is joining some club. </p>
<p>I have joining charity club which is iCare Malaysia and College Volunteer Club which is Jawatankuasa Perwakilan Kolej Dato Onn, Session 2018/2019. But, I would like to share about College Volunteer Club because a lot of experience I got from this club.</p>

<p>This is a group of student which is we called "Sekretrariat Kolej Dato Onn" who are volunteer to help us in doing some activity in college. Mostly, if we are having or doing a event for all the student, they will involved to help. We will divided in some group to performed the task before, during and after event. Each of teams will take our own responsiblilty to do every task as required for having a good and smooth event. </p>

<p> Below is one of the event that we do outside UiTM Kelantan. We had went to SK Ipoh, Tanah Merah, Kelantan to meet and doing some activity with some of special kids that study at Prasekolah Kanak-Kanak Khas, SK Ipoh.

<p>During this event, I have been assigned to be as the informal emcee event. I have learned a lot when I being the informal emcee for the event because I can interact will all the special kids and give them enjoyable while playing the games we provided. Other than having experience to interact with them, I also can improved my communication skill when facing a lot of people. Become a informal emcee is some a good practice to be more confident when communicate or giving instruction. </p>

<p> Joining club not just get some experience, but we can add our friends list from different faculty or course and also create some memorable scene together with our teams. If we are really likes to involve in non academic club, we need to plan our time effectively for balance academic and non academic. So that our study is not affected and run smoothly until last semester.
